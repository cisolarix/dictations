# TODO: 待校验

This week Barack Obama began his second term as President of the United States.

The public swearing-in ceremony took place on Monday at the Capitol building in Washington.

In the speech, Mr. Obama read from parts of the United States constitution and the Declaration of the Independence.

"We'll make us susceptional, we'll make us American. It's our allegiance to an idea articulated in a Declaration made more than two centuries ago. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal."

Officials estimated that over 1 million people gathered on Washington's National Mall for the inaugural ceremonies.

Some keen for the musical performances, but others wanted to hear how President Obama would define goals for the next four years.

In his speech, Mr. Obama said he will make climate change one of his top goals.

He said that failing to deal with the threat from rising temperatures would betray the world's children.

"Some may still deny the overwhelming judgement of science, but none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires, crippling droughts and more powerful storms."

Environmental groups welcomed the President the desire to act on climate change.

The Sierra club called his comments heartening.

It said global warming isn't urgent issue for the whole world.

But many opponents of Mr. Obama's polices disagree.

They say it would cost too much for American economy to move away from using oil and other fossil fuels.
