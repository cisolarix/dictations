This week, Ethiopians were closely following any news about the condition of Prime Minister Meles Zenawi.

A spokesman said in Addis Ababa on Thursday that the Prime Minister was taking sick leave on doctor's orders.

Spokesman Bereket Simon said Mr. Meles's health was good, but he needed time to recover from an illness caused in part by an overload of work.

"Regarding his illness, I think I have told you that he is in good condition, he has got very good treatment for the ailment, and definitely he is in good condition."

Mr. Bereket did not give any details of what the 57-year-old Prime Minister was being treated for or where, but he denied reports on Ethiopian dissident websites that Mr. Meles had brain cancer.

The spokesman said the government was operating as normal, and that Mr. Meles was still in power.

"All the things I can say you is , he has to take some rests, doesn't mean that nobody in charge."

His comments followed media reports that the Ethiopian leader was in critical condition at a hospital in Belgium.

David Chin, formerly American Ambassador to Ethiopia, told VOA that he had no information about the Prime Minister's health. But, he said, the spokesman's comments suggested a serious health issue.
