Dogs are known for a strong sense of smell.

Their noses can be trained to identify different odors.

Dogs are often used in search and rescue operations, and to sniff for things like drugs and explosives.

Some dogs have even been trained to sniff for cancer in people.

Researchers have been trying to reproduce the extraordinary sense of smell that real dogs are born with.

Now officials at the Glasco airport in Scotland are testing a new security device called an electronic sniffer dog.

The electronic sniffer dog represents one of the latest developments in the area of smell technology.

A Scottish company, Cascade Technologies, joined with the French security company, Morfo, to develop it.

The device uses laser to identify explosive material and gases in the air.

The purpose is to identify explosives that may be hidden on a person's body.

The machine looks similar to the metal detectors now used at airports.

Passengers walk through the machine, as the lasers test the surrounding air.

People are not required to take off their coats, belts or shoes as part of the security process.

And unlike full body scanners, the new device does not show images of the passenger.
