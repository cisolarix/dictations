The Hubble Space Telescope continues to make valuable discoveries after more than 20 years in orbit around the Earth.

Hubble recently showed a fourth moon orbiting Pluto.

Astronomers temporarily named it P4.

The moon is the smallest to be discovered around the icy dwarf planet.

Astronomers estimate that the moon is from 13 to 34 kilometers across.

They first saw it in a Hubble photo taken on June 28.

The American Space Agency, NASA, launched the Hubble telescope in 1990.

Reaching that day took years of work.

Ed Weiler is NASA's chief astronomer.

Mr. Weiler has worked closely with the Hubble program since 1979.
