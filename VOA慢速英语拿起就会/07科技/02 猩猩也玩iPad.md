Humans are not the only ones who like to use tablet computers.

A non-profit organization, Orangutans Outreach, has started a program called Apps for Apes using Apple's iPad.

Orangutans Outreach was started by Richard Zimmerman, and is based in New York city.

He began the organization 6 years ago, with the goal of protecting orangutans in the wild.

The organization started Apps for Apes one year ago.

The program introduces the Apple iPad to orangutans in zoos.

Apps for Apes has three goals.

The first goal is to provide interesting activities for captive xxs.

The second goal is to raise awareness among zoo visitors about how smart these animals are.

The third goal is to urge people to visit Orangutans Outreach's website, redapes.org, to learn how they can help protect xxx in the wild.

Orangutans Outreach says the iPad is a perfect device for the animal becasue of the touch screen technology.

With some assistance, orangutans are able to use different apps, to listen to music, play games and do other activities.

The program was first launched at the Milwaukee County zoo.

It has expanded to more than 10 other zoos, as well as a resuce center for apes in the United States and Cananda, and is growing worldwide.
