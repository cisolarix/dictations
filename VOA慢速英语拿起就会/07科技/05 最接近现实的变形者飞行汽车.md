You could fill the sky with all the ideas people have had for flying cars, or what Carl Dietrich calls flying-driving vehicles.

"Since the turn of the 20th century, there have been many hundreds of published concepts of flying-driving vehicles. And some of them have actually been built and flown, but, at this point, the transition ~~be~~ **is the** closest to getting to the market place."

He says, the transition roadable aircraft easily changes to a car.

The transition had to meet federal safety standards for cars and aircraft.

Last year, the Federal Aviation Administration agreed to let it weigh more than other light sport aircraft.

But even fully loaded, says Mr. Dietrich, it still weighs about half as much as an average car.

Carl Dietrich says the aircraft can climb to more than 3000 meters.

It can carry 2 people at speeds over 160 kilometers an hour in the air, and on the ground, it can drive at high speeds around 113 kilometers an hour.
