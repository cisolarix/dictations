Have you ever heard the expression, a ball of energey?

People often use the term to describe very active children.

But today we tell about an invention called the SOCCKET that is a real ball of energy.

Julia Silverman explains.

"The SOCCKET is a cutting-edge portable generator in the form of a soccer ball. "

Julia Silverman and Jessica Matthews developed the SOCCKET as part of a group project for an engineering class at Harvard University.

To better understand what a SOCCKET is, you first need to understand how it works.

"When you play with the ball, there's all this energy being transferred to the ball, even any normal soccer ball. ~~This is~~ **Basically** what we're trying to do is instead of letting that energy ~~disappear~~ **dissipate** into the environment or just be lost. We are harnessing it inside using these mechanisms ~~and~~, **this** technology that is essentially try to capture everything with the movement. Everything that is harnessed is then stored in a battery of sorts."

The SOCCKET collects and stores this energy with every kick, hit or throw of the ball.
