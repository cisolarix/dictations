Nigeria has launched the first satellite designed and built by Africans.

The Nigeria Sat-X is one of two earth observation satellites that the country recently launched.

These are Nigeria's third and fourth satellites.

The Nigeria Sat-X is the result of a training agreement between the National Space Research and Development Agency and a company called Surrey Satellite Technology.

26 Nigerian engineers attended a training program over an 18 month period at the satellite developer's offices in the United Kingdom.

Steve Young is head of business development for the company.

He says the skills that the young Nigerian scientists have learned will help more than just their country's space program.

“You are now beginning to train a corps of very experienced engineers, high-technology technicians, and people who are going to benefit the wider economy. That also is a very good effect that the Nigerians get in investing in high-tech programs. They've got to develop their economy, and that's one of the ways they do that is by doing this.”
