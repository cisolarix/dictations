An American air strike in Yemen has killed Anwar al-Awlaki. He lead the group known as al-Qaeda in the Arabian peninsula.

"Death of Awlaqi is a major blow to al-Qaeda's most active operational affiliate"

President Obama said al-Qaeda in the Arabian peninsula remains dangerous but weakened.


Anwar al-Awlaki was born in the United States.

He urged his followers around the world to kill Americans.

It is either us or them, He said.

He built a loyal following through YouTube, Facebook and a blog.

The United States government approved Mr. al-Awlaki for killing without trial, a rare step for an American citizen.

A missile attack from a drone or unmanned aircraft killed him early Friday in eastern Yemen.

Several other suspected militants also died.

Yemen's Defense Ministry said they included Samir Khan, a militant raised in the United States.

He produced an English language magazine for al-Qaeda that appeared on the internet.
