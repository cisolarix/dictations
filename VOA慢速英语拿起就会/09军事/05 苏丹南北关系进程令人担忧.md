South Sudan is preparing to declare its independence on July 9.

But recent events have raised concerns about the peace process that ended years of civil war with Sudan's north.

Last month, northern forces ~~ceased~~ **Abyei** most of Abyei, an area rich in oil fields in the central part of Sudan.

The south voted for separation in January.

People in Abyei were supposed to decide that same day whether to join the north or the south.

But that never happened because of a disagreement over who could vote.

The United Nation says tens of thousands of people fled after northern troops and allied ~~malisia~~ **malitia** occupied the area on May 21.

They forced out troops from south Sudan.

Based on early reports, Abyei's former chief administrator said about 100 civilians were killed.

There was no independent confirmation of that number.
