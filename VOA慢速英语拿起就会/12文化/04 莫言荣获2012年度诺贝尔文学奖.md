The Swedish academy in Stockholm on Thursday named Mo Yan winner of the 2012 Nobel Prize in literature.

The academy praised the Chinese writer for what it called his hallucinatory realism.

It noted his ability to combine folk stories, history and modern events in his works.

An academy official said Mr. Mo said he was over-joyed and scared when he learned he had won the award.

He will receive his Nobel diploma, a medal and more than $1 million at a ceremony in Stockholm in December.

Mo Yan is a leading author of modern Chinese novels.

He often writes from memories from his youth.

He also sets many of his stories in the area when he was born, Shandong province in northeastern China.

Mr. Mo's 1987 book, Red Sorghum, is an example.

It is about the extreme violence in rural eastern China during the communist revolution in the 1920s and 1930s.

The story describes the criminal culture of the time, Japan's occupation and the terrible conditions faced by farm workers.

Red Sorghum was later made into a movie.

Mo Yan's other major works include Big Breasts and White Hips, Republic of Wine and Life and Death Are Wearing Me Out.

The Royal Swedish Academy compared him to two 20th century writers, American William Faulkner and Columbia's Gabriel García Márquez.

Mo Yan is 57. His real name is Guan Moye. Mo Yan means "don't speak".

The writer said he chose the name to remember to stop his tongue from getting him in trouble.
