Hundreds of thousands of Russians die every year from diseases linked to smoking.

The country has one of the highest smoking rates in the world.

The World Health Organization estimates that 40% of adults in Russia smoke.

That is about 44 million people.

The WHO says China leads the world in tobacco smoking rates.

It says Russia is second.

Russia Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev wants to reduce the number of smokers in his country.

He has proposed a ban on smoking in public places by 2015, and a ban on all tobacco advertising.

And he wants to increase the country's very low cigarette taxes.

In Russia, a pack of cigarettes can cost between 1 and 2 dollars.

Mr. Medvedev appeared in an internet video about the issue.

He said Russians must stop smoking. He said about 90% of Russian smokers begin smoking before they reach the age of 20.

He said smoking kills about 400,000 people in Russia each year.

He likened the loss of life to a large city disappearing from the country's map.

In the video, Mr. Medvedev also warned about the way smoking kills.

He described long and painful deaths from cancer or emphysema, as well as sudden deaths from heart attack and stroke.
