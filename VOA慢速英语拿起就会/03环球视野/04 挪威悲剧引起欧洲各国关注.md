Conservative extremism in Europe are facing new attention after the attacks last week that killed almost 80 people in Norway.

The violence was Norway's deadliest since World War II.

32-year-old Norwegian Anders Behring Breivik has admitted responsibility.

But he has pleaded not guilty to terrorism charges.

He said he was part of a wider crusade against muslim immigration and multi-culturalism in Europe.

Investigators say they believe he acted alone.

They questioned him Friday for a second time.

European Union officials say they will form a team of experts to investigate non-Islamist threats in Scandinavian countries.

The criminal intelligence agency Europol says the team may look at other European nations in the future.

A report this year from Europol said extreme left-wing groups carried out 45 attacks in Europe last year.

It said there were no terrorist attacks by right-wing groups but extremists were increasingly active on the internet.
