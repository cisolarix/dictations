The United Nations estimates that the world food production will have to increase by 70% by 2050.

A world population growing in number and wealth will require one billion tons more grain each year and 200 million tons more meat.

The Food and Agriculture Organization says those gains will have to happen largely on existing land through sustainable intensification.

Officials say the new report provides the first global assessment of the state of the planet's land resources.

It says large parts of all continents are experiencing damage.

One fourth of all land is described as highly degraded.

The greatest threats are losses of soil quality, bio-diversity and water resources.

New agricultural methods and technology increased food production in many countries during the green revolution.

Crop landing increased by 12% from 1961 to 2009.

Yet production grew by 150%.
