This week, families and friends buried victims of the second worst attack on a school in the United States.

A gunman killed 20 young children and 6 adults at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, last Friday.

Police believe 20-year-old Adam Lanza killed his mother at home, then took some of her guns with him to the school.

They say he used a military-style assault rifle to carry out the shooting spree.

Such weapons can fire ~~emuletion~~ *ammunition* quickly without the shooter having to reload.

The attack shot the Americans whose opinions on gun laws have changed in the past week.

A recent survey found that 52% of Americans questioned said they supported major restrictions on guns or making them illegal.

President Obama says he recognizes the need for change.

He has called on Congress to re-establish an assault weapons ban that ended in 2004.

"We may never know all the reasons why this tragedy happen. We do know, that everyday sense more Americans have died of gun violence.
We know such violence has terrible consequences for our society.
And if there's even one thing that we can do to prevent any of these events. We have a deep obligation, all of us, to try."

The President has named Vice President Joe Biden to lead an effort to propose gun law reforms.

He also called for background investigations for anyone buying weapons from a private dealer.
