Secretary of State Hilary Clinton says the release of thousands of State Department documents will not, in any way, interfere with American diplomacy.

Secretary Clinton condemned the release of diplomatic cables as an attack on American foreign policy interest and the international community.

She said the United States is taking aggressive steps to hold responsible those who stole the information.

And she said it is taking action to make sure it does not happen again.

But the Secretary of State said the real damage to America's international relationships will be small.

She made the comments during a visit to Kazakhstan Wednesday.

Secretary Clinton spoke by telephone with a number of world leaders to express regret for the release of the documents.

She made this statement on Monday.

The website WikiLeaks planned to publish more than 250,000 diplomatic cables this week.

Several newspapers have been reporting details of the documents.

They include statements by American diplomats about the private and public lives of world leaders.

They also include criticisms of governments around the world.
