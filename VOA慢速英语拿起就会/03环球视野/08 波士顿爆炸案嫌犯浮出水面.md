American law enforcement officials this week looked for suspects in the bombings at the Boston marathon.

Three people were killed when two bombs exploded near the finish line on Monday.

More than 170 others were injured.

On Thursday, Federal investigators released a video tape and pictures taken around the time of the Boston bombings.

The images showed two young men carrying backpacks.

Officials believed the bombs were transported in the bags.

Friday, police identified the suspects as brothers and ethnic churches.

The two were born in Kyrgyzstan and lived for several years in Dagestan before coming to the United States as refugees.

The uncle of the brothers spoke to reporters from his home in the state of Maryland.

He says, the brothers' family is Muslim.

He also confirmed their ethnic identity.

The issue of identity is complex.
