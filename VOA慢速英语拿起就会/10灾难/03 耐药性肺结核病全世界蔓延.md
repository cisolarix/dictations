In December, doctors in Mumbai, India reported about a group of patients with what they called totally **drug-resistant** tuberculosis.

Indian health officials have been investigating these cases~~, what hey~~ But there have been reports of untreatable cases of TB in the past.

Doctors reported 15 patients in Iran in 2009, and two patients in Italy in 2007.

Tuberculosis is a bacterial disease that usually targets the lungs.

It causes an estimated 5,000 deaths each day or about 2 million a year.

TB can be spread through the air, when an infected person coughs or sneezes or even speaks.

Some forms of TB bacteria no longer react to one or more of the antibiotics commonly used to cure the disease.

These are known as **drug-resistant** ~~strengths~~ **strains**.

Some even resist more drugs.

The World Health Organization says 69 countries have reported cases of "extensively drug resistant" tuberculosis.

The WHO says at least 25,000 such cases are reported worldwide every year.
