Broadband is one of the fastest growing areas of the telecommunications industry.

A report from the broadband forum says the number of broadband subscribers reached 498 million worldwide in June.

By the 3rd week of July, it has tased 500 million.

That represents one in five homes worldwide.

Mrs. Gunzalas says much of the growth has come from an unexpected source.

"One of the things that were really xxxed with broadband is that there are market opening up, especially for emerging and developing countries that they would've never had an audience for."

Asia represents almost 41% of the total broadband subscriptions.

More than 120 million of those subscribers are in China.

The report from the broadband forum also looked at Internet Protocol Television, or IPTV.

IPTV is one of the main developments leading the growth in broadband.
