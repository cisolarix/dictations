In the American legal system, people generally bring civil claims as individuals.

But if a lot of people have similar claims, they may try to bring a class-action lawsuit.

But groups need permission to bring a class-action, and that can be denied.

That happened this week to a million and a half current and former employees of America's largest private employer.

The woman accused Wal-Mart of discriminating against female employees in its stores.

But the United States Supreme Court voted to block a huge class-action against Wal-Mart in federal court.


The case started about ten years ago.

A federal district court in California agreed that the case could go forward as a class-action.

Wal-Mart again lost in a federal appeal's court.

But on Monday, Wal-Mart wanted appeal in the nation's highest court.

The court was divided five to four in its rooming, yet all nine justices agreed that the case could not go forward.

The woman needed to meet additional legal requirements, because they were seeking payment for harm they say was done.

All the justices agreed these requirements had not been met.
