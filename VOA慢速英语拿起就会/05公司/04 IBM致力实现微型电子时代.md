Controling a device with your mind, powering your home with the energy of your own activities, these are two of the developments that experts at IBM think will become reality within the next five years.

The technology company has released its latest five in five report.

The experts think people will soon be able to control many electronic devices simply by using their minds.

Scientists at IBM and other companies are researching ways to do this in a field of science known as bio-informatics.

They say people will soon have a way to just think about calling or emailing someone in order to make it happen.

Burnie Mileson is IBM's vice president of innovation.

Another prediction is a way for people to power their homes or offices using energy from activities like walking or running.

Bernie Mileson says this is known as micro-electronic generation.
