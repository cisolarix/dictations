The Microsoft corporation is making progress in efforts to stop one of the most harmful cyber crime operations active today.

It is called Zeus.

Last week, an American judge ordered the group of cyber criminals to end their illegal activities.

A week earlier, federal officials raided office buildings in two states and seized evidence related to the Zues family of computer software.

Richard XXX is with Microsoft's Digital Crimes Unit.

"The objective is to go in there and be able to seize evidence

which will lead us to hopefully identify the individuals behind the Zeus family of malware

as well as ultimately identify the computers of people all over the world that are compromised

being used to victimize others and they don't even know about it."

Cyber criminals use Zeus to create a network of infected computers or bot-net to steal personal information from computer users.

Mr. XXX says the operation reaches around the world.
