The iPhone has become one of the most popular mobile phones in the United States.

An 18-year-old student in California has used his knowledge of the device to create his own business, and he has gained national recognition for his work.

Vincent Quigg is the Chief Executive Officer of TechWorld. His company is kind of like a hospital for iPhones.

"I'm 18 years old. I'm a college student and I'm the CEO ~~on~~ **and** founder of TechWorld where we specialize in customizing and repairing iPhones."

Vincent Quigg launched TechWorld while in high school. An organization called the Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship or NFTE helped the young man get started.

Both he and his mother, Carla Quigg, admit that he had a hard time developing a business plan.

At the time, Vincent worked for the electronic store BestBuy. He says people always came into the store with broken electronic devices.

He decided that repairing those devices was what he wanted to do.

He not only re-registered for the NFTE class, but he also won the organization's national competition for best young entrepreneur.

His business has grown through word-of-mouth.

Vincent says he now fixes up to 10 phones per week.

He earns about $1,500 each month in sales.

Brisa Munoz is one of his satisfied customers.

"I actually ~~lived up~~ *looked him up* ~~upon~~ *on* the internet because I had heard so much about ~~the~~ *this* kid ~~and~~ *how* he won the entrepreneur of the year. So I ~~lick~~ *looked* him up and *I was like*, *whoo*, ~~who~~ I want him to fix my phone."
