Google is preparing for changes in its privacy policy, beginning March 1.

The company says it plans to replace more than 60 separate policies for different products with one main policy.

Privay activists critisized last month's annoucement.

They are concerned that the new policy will make it easier to track the activities of users across Google's many products, from Gmail to YouTube.

Marc Rotenberg heads the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington.

He says Google's aim is to create a single unified profile of its users.

"We believe that not only ~~it's~~ **is that** a threat to privacy.

We actually believe it's illegal because last year Google entered into an agreement with U.S. Federal Trade Comission **in** which they said they would not engage in that kind of data sharing without the explicit permission of **their** users."
