Amazon.com launched its kindle librray lending service in the United States last week.

Millions of users of the kindle reader and app can now borrow kindle books from their local public library.

The company is working with Overdrive, a leading suppplier of ebooks and other digital content, to libraries.

The service will be available through the websites of more than 11,000 local libraries across the country.

Users of other devices, including the Barnes & Noble NOOK and SONY reader have aleardy been able to borrow library books.

Experts say Amazon's entry is likely to re-open a debate between publishers and libraries over ebook lending.

Mr. XXX says the debate in the United States centers on what is knows as the law of first sale.

This law is what permits libraries to lend books over and over again without having to pay publishers each time.

But Bill Rosenblack points out that it does not include digital products.

Technology known as Digital Rights Management can make ebooks unreadable once they have reached a certain time or user limit.
