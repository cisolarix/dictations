Bad teeth can be painful and worse, they can even be deadly.

Infections of the gums and teeth can release bacteria into the blood system.

Those bacteria can increase the chances of **a** heart attack and stroke and worsen the effects of other diseases.

And adults are not the only ones ~~that~~ **at** risk.

For example, in 2007, doctors in Washington area said a boy died when a tooth infection spread to his brain.

They said it might have been prevented had he received dental care he needed. He was 12 years old.

Experts at the National Institutes of Health say good dental care starts at birth.

Breast milk, they say, is the best food for the healthy development of teeth.

Breast milk can **help** slow bacterial growth and acid production in the mouth.

The use of ~~fluorine~~ **fluoride** to protect the teeth is common in many parts of the world.

For example, it is often added to drinking water supplies.

The ~~fluorine~~ **fluoride** mixes with enamel, the hard surface on teeth, to help prevent holes or cavities from forming.
