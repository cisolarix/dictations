# Grand Canyon Lives Up to its Name

The Grand Canyon ~~on~~ in the southwestern state of Arizona is a stunning creation. National park's traveler Mikah Meyer can see why.

"It's grand, that's the right word to use for it. Because whether standing at the rim, or overlooking it, or being down on the river, you just get a sense of how massive the Grand Canyon is."

Shaped by millions of years of erosion, a distinctly colored canyon is 446 kilometers long, and averages about 1,220 meters deep, the length of 11 football fields.

"What's so unique is that you have all these layers of **the** earth that were once underground **that have been** uplifted and **then** eroded away, so scientists can see millions and millions and millions of years of earth's crust history. "

Scientists and visitors both can explore the massive canyons by foot and by raft, which is what Mikah did on an 8-day, 362 kilometers rafting trip, on ~~a~~ the Colorado river.

"Here we go."

"Coming ~~up~~ along on the ~~rampents~~ rapids here."

One of his favorite experiences was ~~the~~ a trip to the little Colorado river, a tributary just ~~of~~ off the main river.

"What made this little Colorado so special is that it was this almost baby blue, light blue-white color, and you see the moment ~~when~~ where it converges with this dark-grey ~~color on the~~ Colorado river and these two vastly different colors coming together."

"Lay flat, lay flat."

Mikah and his fellow travelers enjoy the creeks, the waterfalls, and places where the water is still and where one can see naturally forming springs.

"Rapid."

But the highlight ~~from~~ for Mikah was navigating the ~~white water rabbits~~ whitewater rapids that the river is famous for.

"All ready to go for ~~a love of~~ lava falls in the front of the boat."

Visitors also learn about the river's rich history.

"To the right, you'll see some historic native American food storage ~~greeneries~~ granaries."

And check out the wild life, like the endangered Californian condor.

"They brought ~~fans~~ them to the Grand Canyon ~~, can~~ to try to provide **a** ~~inhabitant~~ habitat **that** they thought would help them thrive. And thus far, it's been doing pretty well."

And in evenings, Mikah and his group camp**ed** on the shore. A perfect way to end each day in one of the world's most beautiful and natural playgrounds.

"Everybody, give me a wave."

"The world could've gone to nuclear war for all we would've known. It was just this amazing moment to truly be in nature, truly be void of the distraction of the world. Enjoy that ~~sponder~~ splendor of nature, enjoy the people you are around in a way that is so rare today."
