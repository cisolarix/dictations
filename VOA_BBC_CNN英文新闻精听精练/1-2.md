# Obama, in Mideast speech, supports Palestinian Demand

President Obama discussed the political unrest in the Middle East and North Africa in a speech Thursday in Washington.

The President announced new aid to help democracy efforts in Egypt and Tunisia. The leaders of both countries were overthrown earlier this year.

And Mr. Obama strongly condemned Syria's President Bashar al-Assad.  

Mr. Obama linked the protests in the Arab world to unmet economic needs.

The President also said he disagrees with people who argue that moving forward on a Middle East peace plan is not possible now because of all the change taking place. In his words, "the drive for a lasting peace that ends the conflict and resolves all claims is more urgent than ever."

Mr. Obama gave his support to a major Palestinian demand. He said the borders of Israel and the future Palestine should be based on lines that existed before the 1967 Middle East War.
