First up, we are looking at President Obama's first news conference since he was re-elected to a second term. The President took questions from the media for about an hour at the White House yesterday afternoon.

One topic that came up, ~~is~~ the so-called ~~physical~~ **fiscal** cliff. ~~to set up~~

It's a set of spending cuts and tax increases that could go ~~a new~~ into effect soon.

The President and Congressional leaders are considering ways to avoid that cliff.

President Obama was set to meet with business leaders after yesterday's news conference to talk about the issue.

He said he wants input from everyone.

"I am open to new ideas if the Republican counterparts or some Democrats have a great idea for us to raise revenue, maitain ~~progressivity~~ progress already, make sure the middle classes ~~get~~ isn't getting hit, reduces our deficit, encourages growth. I'm not gonna just slam the door ~~on~~ in their face. I want to hear ideas form everybody."
