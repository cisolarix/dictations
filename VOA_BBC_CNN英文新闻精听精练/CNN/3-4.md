And this year you'll see more of what're called OLED televions, these are ~~all trusted~~ ultrathin and offer the best picture on the market.

And pretty much every TV you see has 3D functionality and ~~connected~~ connects to the internet.

One of the big ~~things~~ **themes of the show is seeing all** accessories for smartphones and tablets.

**This is** one of **the** more ~~usual~~ unusual ~~contraction~~ contraptions ~~you've~~ we've seen.

This turns your iPad into a guitar. This is ~~the~~ a product from ~~Eye-On~~ Ion ~~. It~~ that will retail for $99 when it comes out this summer. And it teaches you how to play ~~a~~ the guitar.

Panasonic is trying to give us a sense **as to** what cars might look like in the future. This is not a video game, but a vision to make driving safer and easier.
