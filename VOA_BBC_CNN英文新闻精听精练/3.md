# What Now for Al-Qaeda After Death of Bin Ladin?

Al-Qaeda on Friday confirmed the death of its leader, Osama Bin Ladin. The SITE intelligence group said Al-Qaeda released a statement on militant websites. The statement threatened more attacks on Americans and their allies.

Al-Qaeda also urged Pakistanis to rebel against their government. It urged them to "cleanse the shame that has been attached to them" by the death in Pakistan. American Special Forces killed Osama Bin Ladin early Monday during a raid on a house where he had been living.

President Obama announced the news late Sunday night in Washington. Abbottabad is about two-hours drive from Islamabad, the Pakistani capital, and has a large military presence. But Pakistani officials say they have no idea the Al-Qaeda leader was there. Mr. Obama said his death does not mark the end of the threat.

Mr. Obama also had a message for families who lost loved ones to Al-Qaeda's terror.
