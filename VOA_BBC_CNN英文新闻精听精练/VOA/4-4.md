Amanda Pease is one of almost 40 volunteers serving in rural schools in Sierra Leone.

~~Miss~~ Ms. Pease teaches science at San Joseph's, a high school in eastern Sierra Leone.

She studied chemical engineering at the university of California, Los Angeles.

She decided to serve for two years in the Peace Corps after she finished her degree.

More than 8000 Peace Corps volunteers are currently serving around the world.

Volunteers become part of the community where they work and live.

Travis Bluemling from Pennsylvania teaches English in a rural Indonesian community.

"Even if some of these kids can't get to college, learning English and ~~we know~~ at least some knowledge of the language can separate themselves from the people next to them when they are looking for a job or meeting people"

Mr. Bluemling's family expressed concern for his safety in a country where Islamic militant**s** have sometimes attacked Westerners.

But what concerned him, he says, was the thought that leaders in his village might not welcome him.

"However, I couldn't ~~be~~ have been more wrong. They've ~~let~~ allowed me ~~into~~ to enter their house. I joined them in their Muslim meetings. I joined them with fasting, and I**ve** even enter**ed** the Mosque."
