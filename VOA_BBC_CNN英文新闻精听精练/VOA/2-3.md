The World Economic Forum says the most likely risk facing the world over the next ten years is the severe disparity in income between rich and poor.

The estimate was made in a new report called the World Economic Forum's Global Risks 2013.

Many of the issues discussed in the report are familiar.

Food availability and the spread of extremism and terrorism are noted every year.

But new risks, especially technological and financial ones, are becoming more important than ever.

The World Economic Forum is based in Geneva, Switzerland.

The non-profit group says its risk report is based on surveys of more than 1,000 experts from around the world.

They include industry leaders and specialists in government, academics and civil society.

The experts consider the likelihood that risks could become serious problems in the future.

They also study the impact or influence that these risks would have if they become reality.

The experts judge the likelihood that a risk would become a problem over the next ten years.

Sharp income differences between rich and poor were the risk considered most likely.

This is the second time in two years that the disparity in wealth was identified as the most likely problem.
