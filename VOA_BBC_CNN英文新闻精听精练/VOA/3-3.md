Brady Cox is an assistant professor of civil engineering at the university of Arkansas.

"One thing, I think, a lot of people don't understand is that building codes are meant to prevent loss of life in earthquake.

And that doesn't mean that the building is wont or bridges for that matter anything won't sustain significant damage."

Mr. Cox says Japan has invested a lot in seismic research and design.

Since a magnitude 7.5 earthquake in the gutter in 1964, that same year, a 9.2 quake shook the American state of Alaska.

"Those two earthquakes really opened up a lot of new research on something called soil liquefaction in particular.

And, you know, the Japanese, they have more earthquakes greater than magnitude 6 or 7 than probably any other country in the world.

I mean, they get hit a lot."

Soil liquefaction is the process by which the strength or stiffness of soil is weakened by an event like the shaking of an earthquake.

The soil begins to move like liquid. Professor Cox says the first step to designing an earthquake resistent building is to study the soil.
