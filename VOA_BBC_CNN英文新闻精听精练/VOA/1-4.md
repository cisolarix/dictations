# What next with the military campaign in Libya?

President Obama discussed the situation in Libya with Congressional leaders again Friday. Some in Congress say he should have sought Congressional approval for American military action. Critics include members of his own Democratic party.

But a spokesman says the President was well within his constitutional rights to order missile attacks on Libyan military bases. The strikes began last Saturday.

On Thursday, NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization agreed to take command of a no-fly zone over Libya. A Canadian general will <s>hear</s> head the alliance's operation there.

The United Nations Security Council approved the <s>light</s> flight ban last week to protect civilians, including those in Benghazi. That eastern city is the center of a rebellion against Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.

Planes from an international coalition carried out new strikes Friday against Libyan military targets, south of Benghazi. Earlier, the United Arab Emirates agreed to send 12 planes to help enforce the no-fly zone.

Many experts say air power alone will not protect civilians. Some wonder whether the objective should be to oust Colonel Gaddafi. But the United States says the regime change is not the goal of the coalition. There're diplomatic efforts to settle the crisis.
