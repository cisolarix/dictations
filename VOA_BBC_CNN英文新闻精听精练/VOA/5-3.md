When we think of threats to public health, we ofter think of communicable diseases.

But experts say non-communicable diseases, those that do not spread from person to person, are the leading killer today.

These are often the result of poor diet and environmental influences, including tobacco and alcohol use or genetics.

Now the World Health Organization has released its first global status report on non-communicable diseases.

In 2008, they caused 63% of all deaths. And 80% of those deaths were reported in developing countries.

These countries are spending billions to treat conditions like cancer, heart disease and diabetics.

The WHO says the costs of treating non-infectious diseases are pushing millions of people into poverty.

WHO director general Migrate Chan says for some countries, it is no exaggeration to describe the situation as an impending disaster.

A disaster for health, society and national economies.
