# A Stock Market Big Enough to Stretch Across the Atlantic

A ten-billion-dollar deal aims to create the world's largest exchange company. The plan would combine the operators of the New York Stock Exchange and Germany's Frankfurt Stock Exchange.

The two companies NYSE Euronext and Deutsch Borse announced the agreement Tuesday. Deutsch Borse shareholders would own about 60% of the combined group. One thing it still needs is a name. The new company would have headquarters in Frankfurt and New York.

The New York Stock Exchange is the world's most famous stock market and the symbol of American capitalism.

Treasury Secretary Tim Gartner says New York will remain at the heart of the world's financial system for a long time to come.

But the exchange business has changed in these days of high-speed trading by computers in a globally connected economy. The Big Board now has to compete with smaller exchanges. Where stocks are traded has become less important than how much those trades cost.
