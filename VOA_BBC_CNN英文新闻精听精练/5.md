# American Intelligence Office Predicts China Will Be World's Leading Economic Power by 2030

A new American intelligence report this week predicted Asia's economic power rising in the coming years. The report says that by the year 2030, the United States will no longer be the super power it is today. It says that no nation will have that kind of influence, with power instead redirected to coalitions between countries.

The report comes from the National Intelligence Council of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The document was researched and written by experts from outside the government. They say the findings are meant to help policymakers in their long-term planning on major issues.

The report says the world will look different by 2030. The economy in Asia will be larger than that of North America and Europe combined. China will have the largest economy in the world. And the Chinese economy will be 140% greater than Japan's economy.

Some observers say China needs to take steps before it can become the world's biggest economy. Patrick Chovanec is with Tsinghua University's School of Economics and Management in Beijing. He believes that several things could affect the country's economic growth.
