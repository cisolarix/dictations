Security forces in Egypt have raided the offices of a number of pro-democracy and human rights groups. Computers and papers are said to have been seized.

Among the offices raided are U.S.-based organizations, the National Democratic Institute and the International Republican Institute. The United States said it's deeply concerned over the raids. The spokeswoman, Victoria Nuland, described them as inappropriate.

"We call on the Egyptian government to immediately end the harassment of the NGOs, NGO staff, return all property and resolve this issue, immediately."

Egypt recently blamed foreign intervention for the resurgence of anti-government protests.
