The suicide bomber in Iraq has killed more than 50 people and injured dozens in an attack on ~~sheer~~ Shia Pilgrims in the southern city of Basra.

These witnesses described what happened.

"A man wearing a blue jack, I think, was handing out biscuits to pilgrims. A policeman who thought he ~~looks~~ looked suspicious went over to him and arrested him, and that's when the explosion happened."

"~~They~~ There were ~~150~~ 180 people, men and women. And with our own eyes, we saw ambulances evacuating them. God and his prophet can't accept the attack against the visitors of Imam Hussein."
