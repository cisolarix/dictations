Iran says its naval forces have carried out a missile test, shooting down an aerial target with a medium-range rocket.
The launch came during a large military exercise near the Strait of Hormuz.

Change Ranalds reports.

"Iran's Naval commander Mahmoud Mousavi says that the armed forces have successfully tested a new medium-range ground-to-air missile.

Iran has tried and failed to buy this kind of weapon from abroad. So now it's designed its own as a way of defending itself against an attack.

Separately the country's nuclear agency has announced that its scientists have produced the nation's first nuclear fuel rod.

That's potentially a step toward building a nuclear program without any help from abroad."
