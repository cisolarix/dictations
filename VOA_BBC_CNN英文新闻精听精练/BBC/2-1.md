Forbes magazine says there are now a record ~~226~~ 1,266 billionaires on its annual rich list, compared with 140 when it was launched 25 years ago.

The Mexican Telecoms ~~magnet~~ magnate Carlos Slim, who's worth an estimated $69 billion, tops the list for the third year in ~~the roll,~~ a row followed by the software ~~magnet~~ magnate Bill Gates and ~~Financia~~ financier Warren Buffet. No Indian billionaires are in the top ten this year. And the only Chinese one is the Hong Kong property ~~magnet~~ magnate, Li Ka-shing. Steve Forbes explains why.

"Well, what it tells us is there's a lot ~~charms~~ churn, ~~that~~ there hasn't been a lot growth in the economy in the last year. The number of billionaires went up 16, but **yet** some regions go down. China went down a little bit, Russia went down because of weak commodity prices. But the fact ~~of~~ the matter is there hasn't been a lot of **real** vigorous growth in the world, and that's ~~what fucked~~ reflected on the list ~~is~~ this year."
