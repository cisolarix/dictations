The International Monetary Fund says it needs to raise hundreds of billions of dollars so it can give up new loans to countries in urgent need of financial support.

The IMF said it was exploring options for rasing the extra money. From Brussels, Chris Morris reports.

"The IMF estimates that it needs about $500 billion in additional funding to try to ensure that the instablity sworning around the Euro's own doesn't create further problems for the global ecnonmy.

Countries which used the Euro who hopes  sometime on a build-up of IMF resources.

They wanted to help create a much larger financial fire war to prevent the Euro's own dead crisis in larger ecnonmies such as Italy and Spain.

The u countries, not including Britain, have already agreed to contribute about $200 billion to the IMF.

That leaves a considerable gap to be filled."
